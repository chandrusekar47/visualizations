            <h2>Birth death flows of notable individuals in the 19th century</h2>
            <h4>Freebase dataset</h4>
            <div>
                This visualization was designed to answer the following questions: <br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify the countries that are birth sources and the ones that are death attractors (i.e) more favored by notable individuals and artists.</li>
                    <li>Are there any countries that have become less attractive to artists over time?</li>
                    <li>Which countries have no change in migration patterns over the past 200 years?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The size of the circle is a measure of the difference between the death count and the birth count in a country. Countries with more deaths than birth counts are represented in red color and other countries are marked as blue. A large blue circle indicates that a large number of artists have moved out the country.
