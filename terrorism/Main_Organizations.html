<img src="Terror by all organizations.jpeg";">
<p> This line chart shows the trend of the number of terror attacks by all organizations from 1970 to 2015. <br>
As we can see, there was a gradual increase in terrorism around the world throughout the 70s and 80s reaching its pinnacle <br>
during the Gulf War (also known as Operation Desert Shield and Storm). After that war, terrorism declined until the late 90s <br> 
and then reaching another pinnacle in 2001, which was the same year of the 9/11 attacks. Since 2004, terrorism has been greatly <br> 
increasing. In fact, it appears to be growing almost exponentially. </p>

<p> Attacks from Taliban began to increase during the Iraq War and has continued to increase ever since. <br>

<p> There has been a sharp increase in attacks by ISIL (also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) 2013, <br>
 but the number of attacks have been about constant

<img src="BokoHaram.jpeg";">
<p> The Boko Haram is also known as the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP). As we can see, there has been <br>
 a fairly sharp increase from nearly no attacks to nearly 500 attacks per year. </p>

increase from attacks by this group from the late 20th century to 2010. However, the number of attacks has spiked since 2011 <br> reaching 260 in 
2015. </p>
