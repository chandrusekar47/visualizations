        <h2>Analysis of Global Terrorism Dataset 1970-2015</h2>
        <p>
        The goal of this project is to make it easier to identify where terrorism might occur in the future, by what means and organization it might occur, so that it can be prevented. This is an important problem today because of the already large and growing threat of terror by ISIS, Al-Qaeda, lone wolf attacks, and other organizations. This website provides several visualizations that can be used to identify different trends and patterns in terrorist attacks across the world.
